# Reservoir Management

A Tethys application built for INDRHI officials and other water related personnel in the Dominican Republic.
This application **(1)** provides maps and general overview information for major reservoirs, **(2)** has an interface 
for performing simulations based on forecasted rain and streamflow and **(3)** shows historical data and statistics.

This application is the product of a collaboration between INDRHI and senior students from the BYU Civil and 
Environmental Engineering program.

## Overview
There are 3 pages for viewing summary data, reporting new data, and getting instructions to use the app.
The overview page has a map with markers indicating the locations of each of the reservoirs in the country and a table 
with some relevant information about each reservoir including current elevation and usable volume.  

### Report page  
How to use the reporting page

### Instruction page  
Contains most of this information including links to youtube videos that demonstrate using each of these functions.  

## Simulations  
This application can perform simple simulations of reservoirs based on **(1)** current information about the reservoir, 
**(2)** forecasted rain and streamflow, and **(3)** user supplied values for outflows from the reservoir.

A video demonstrating the simulations page can be found

#### How to use the simulations tool
Choose a reservoir. Using the drop down menu located toward the top of the screen, pick a reservoir to do simulations 
for. When you pick a reservoir, the space below the drop down menu will fill with some of the recent, relevant statistics 
about the reservoir such as current level, current volume, or usable volume.


## Historical Data 
The Reservoir Administration App has pages that show historical data and statistics for each of the reservoirs being 
tracked. To view this information, find and click on the name of the reservoir in the menu column found on the left hand 
side of the screen.The page you will be redirected to has 2 major components; **(1)** a graph of historical data and 
**(2)** a table of statistics and summary information.  

#### Historical Data Plot
The graph shows all the data thats is available to the app. The graph linearly connects spaces between missing data. If 
you see a large, straight segment, check the data. If you click and drag, you can select areas of the chart youâ€™re 
interested in to zoom in on. The axes of the graphs have been changed to show depth rather than elevation so that the 
trends are still available but is more zoomed to the curves representing changes in elevation of the reservoir.  

#### Statistics Section
The statistics and summary section shows variables to try to give a better context to the data shown in the graph.
