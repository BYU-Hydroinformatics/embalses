    <h1>Reservoir Management</h1>
    <p>A Tethys application built for INDRHI officials and other water related personnel in the Dominican Republic.
        This application <b>(1)</b> provides maps and general overview information for major reservoirs, <b>(2)</b> has an interface
        for performing simulations based on forecasted rain and streamflow and <b>(3)</b> shows historical data and statistics.
    <p>This application is the product of a collaboration between INDRHI and senior students from the BYU Civil and
        Environmental Engineering program.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>There are 3 pages for viewing summary data, reporting new data, and getting instructions to use the app.
        The overview page has a map with markers indicating the locations of each of the reservoirs in the country and a table
        with some relevant information about each reservoir including current elevation and usable volume.

    <p><b>Report page: </b>How to use the reporting page

    <p><b>Instruction page: </b>Contains most of this information including links to youtube videos that demonstrate using each of these functions.

    <h2>Simulations</h2>
    <p>This application can perform simple simulations of reservoirs based on <b>(1)</b> current information about the reservoir,
        <b>(2)</b> forecasted rain and streamflow, and <b>(3)</b> user supplied values for outflows from the reservoir.

    <p>Video Demonstrations can be found
        <li>In english: (youtube link)</li>
        <li>In spanish: (youtube link)</li>

    <br><p>Using The Simulations Tool
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a reservoir. Using the drop down menu located toward the top of the screen, pick a reservoir to do simulations
            for. When you pick a reservoir, the space below the drop down menu will fill with some of the recent, relevant statistics
            about the reservoir such as current level, current volume, or usable volume.</li>
        <li>Fill out the table</li>
        <li>Press the simulate button</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Historical Data</h2>
    The Reservoir Administration App has pages that show historical data and statistics for each of the reservoirs being
    tracked. To view this information, find and click on the name of the reservoir in the menu column found on the left hand
    side of the screen.The page you will be redirected to has 2 major components; <b>(1)</b> a graph of historical data and
    <b>(2)</b> a table of statistics and summary information.

    <h4>Historical Data Plot</h4>
    The graph shows all the data thats is available to the app. The graph linearly connects spaces between missing data. If
    you see a large, straight segment, check the data. If you click and drag, you can select areas of the chart youâ€™re
    interested in to zoom in on. The axes of the graphs have been changed to show depth rather than elevation so that the
    trends are still available but is more zoomed to the curves representing changes in elevation of the reservoir.

    <h4>Statistics Section</h4>
    The statistics and summary section shows variables to try to give a better context to the data shown in the graph.
